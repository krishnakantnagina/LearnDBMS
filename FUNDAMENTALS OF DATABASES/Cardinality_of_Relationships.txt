**What is Cardinality?**

Cardinality in database relationships tells how many instances of one entity can be associated with one instance of another entity.

In simple words:
It defines the number of records that can relate between two tables.

🔸 Types of Cardinality
1️⃣ One-to-One (1:1)

One record in Table A is related to only one record in Table B.

And vice versa.

Example:

One person → One passport

One student → One roll number

Database Design:

Foreign key is usually placed in one of the tables.

Used when data is split for security or clarity.

2️⃣ One-to-Many (1:N)

One record in Table A can be related to many records in Table B.

But each record in Table B relates to only one record in Table A.

Example:

One teacher → Many students

One customer → Many orders

One department → Many employees

Database Design:

Foreign key is placed in the "Many" side table.

3️⃣ Many-to-Many (M:N)

Many records in Table A can relate to many records in Table B.

Example:

Students ↔ Courses

Authors ↔ Books

Doctors ↔ Patients

Database Design:

We create a junction table (bridge table).

It contains foreign keys from both tables.
