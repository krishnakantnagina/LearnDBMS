Types of Databases
1. Relational Databases

Also known as SQL databases, these databases use a relational model to organize data into tables with rows and columns.

2. NoSQL Databases

These databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, images, or videos.
Example: MongoDB

3. Column Databases

These databases store data in columns rather than rows, making them well-suited for data warehousing and analytical applications.
Examples: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery

4. Graph Databases

These databases are used to store and query graph-structured data, such as social network connections or recommendation systems.
Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

5. Key-Value Databases

These databases store data as a collection of keys and values, making them well-suited for caching and simple data storage needs.
Examples: Redis, Amazon DynamoDB
