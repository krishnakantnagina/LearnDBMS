**Database Keys**

A key in a database is an attribute or a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple (row) in a table.

Keys play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of a database by enforcing unique constraints on the data and establishing relationships between tables.

1. Super Key

A super key is a combination of columns that uniquely identifies any row within a relational database management system (RDBMS) table.

2. Candidate Key

A candidate key is a minimal super key, meaning it has no redundant attributes.

In other words, it is the smallest set of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify a tuple (row) in the table.

3. Primary Key

A primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple in a table.

There can be only one primary key in a table, and it cannot contain null values.

4. Alternate Key

An alternate key is a candidate key that is not used as the primary key.

5. Composite Key

A composite key is a primary key that is made up of two or more attributes.

Composite keys are used when a single attribute is not sufficient to uniquely identify a tuple in a table.
