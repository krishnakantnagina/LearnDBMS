Basic Terms in a Relation (Table) – Simple Notes

A relation in DBMS means a table.

Example table: Employee

1️⃣ Attributes (Columns / Fields)

These are the column names of the table.

Example:

ID

ENAME

SALARY

BONUS

DEPT

👉 The number of columns is called the Degree of the relation.

If a table has 5 columns → Degree = 5

2️⃣ Rows (Records / Tuples)

Each horizontal entry in a table is called:

Row

Record

Tuple

👉 The number of rows is called the Cardinality of the relation.

If a table has 4 rows → Cardinality = 4

3️⃣ Domain

Domain means the set of valid values an attribute can have.

Example:

DEPT → {ICP, ETA, IVS}

SALARY → Only numeric values

ID → Only integer values

So, domain = allowed values of a column.

4️⃣ NULL

NULL means:

No value

Missing value

Unknown value

It is NOT zero and NOT empty string.

5️⃣ Relation Representation

A relation is usually written like this:

Employee(ID, ENAME, SALARY, BONUS, DEPT)


Where:

Employee = Table name

Inside brackets = Attributes
